# 1A-Laser-Buck-Converter-v1

This miniature laser diode driver is capable delivering up to 1A of constant current. With its small size of only 15x10 mm (0.6x0.4 inches) itâ€™s suitable for projects with limited enclosure space. The constant current value is fixed. It can be changed by swapping out the 1206 sized resistor (the value is given in the PAM2804 datasheet)
